# Bibliography and references

- The book [SYNCHRONIZATION AND LINEARITY: An Algebra for Discrete Event Systems](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/metalau/cohen/SED/book-online.html) can be downloaded for free. The Scilab toolbox is based on this book.

- [NSP](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/nsp-tiddly/mine.html) or [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/) Homepage of the official Scilab fork developed by some of the researchers who originally developed Scilab at INRIA and ENPC. This version contains a Max-Plus toolbox. Inside NSP or ScicosLab you can run the Max-Plus demonstration. Go to the `Demos` menu and select `Maxplus demos`. A pdf tutorial is available [here](https://jpquadrat.github.io/TPALGLIN.pdf) explaining the demo. For the help of Max-Plus functions type `help` and click on the `Maxplus` link. Note that the newer version of ScicosLab is named [Nsp](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/nsp-tiddly/mine.html) but does not contain directly the Max-Plus toolbox.

- [Stéphane Gaubert](http://www.cmap.polytechnique.fr/~gaubert) webpage in which you can find the C code source of the Howard algorithm (general "maximal circuit mean" problem, in directed graphs). You can watch [his video](https://youtu.be/yP5qajIL_YM), in French, introducing the (max,+) algebra and petri nets.

- [Jean-Pierre Quadrat](https://github.com/jpquadrat/jpquadrat.github.io) Many English and French PDF documents about (max,+) algebra with applications can be found.

- [Jarosław Stańczyk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323453493_Max-Plus_Algebra_Toolbox_for_Matlab) gives a Matlab version (and/or GNU Octave) including a good introduction document to the Max-Plus algebra, modeling, analysis and control of Discrete Event Systems. His toolbox is available at this [link](http://www.stanczyk.pro/mpa/) I also made a [fork](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MP) of it.

- [Giggle Liu](https://github.com/TensorBFS/TropicalNumbers.jl) An other Julia package for (max,+).
