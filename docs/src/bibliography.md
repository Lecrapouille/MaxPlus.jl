# Bibliography and references

- [NSP](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/nsp-tiddly/mine.html) or [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/) Homepage of the official Scilab fork developed by some of the researchers who originally developed Scilab at INRIA and ENPC. This version contains a Max-Plus toolbox. Inside NSP or ScicosLab you can run the Max-Plus demonstration. Go the `Demos` menu and select `Maxplus demos`. A pdf tutorial is available [here](https://jpquadrat.github.io/TPALGLIN.pdf) explaining the demo. For the help of Max-Plus functions type `help` and click to the `Maxplus` link. Note that the newer version of ScicosLab is named [Nsp](https://cermics.enpc.fr/~jpc/nsp-tiddly/mine.html) but does not contain directly the Max-Plus toolbox.

- [Stéphane Gaubert](https://youtu.be/yP5qajIL_YM) French Youtube video introducing (max,+) algebra and petri nets.

- [Jean-Pierre Quadrat](https://github.com/jpquadrat/jpquadrat.github.io) Many English and French PDF documents about Max-Plus algebra with applications (such as traffic jam) can be found. His book *SYNCHRONIZATION AND LINEARITY: An Algebra for Discrete Event Systems* that can be downloaded [here](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/metalau/cohen/SED/book-online.html).

- [Jarosław Stańczyk](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/323453493_Max-Plus_Algebra_Toolbox_for_Matlab) gives a Matlab version (and/or GNU Octave) including a good introduction document to the Max-Plus algebra, modelling, analysis and control of Discrete Event Systems. I made a [fork](https://github.com/Lecrapouille/MP) of his toolbox since his website no longer exist.
