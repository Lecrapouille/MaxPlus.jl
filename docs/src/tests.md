# Unit tests

If Julia did not complain when installing this package and if you obtained a
good result when typing `MP(5)`, then your (max,+) toolbox has been correctly
installed and seems to work correctly. To be totally sure, you can run unit
tests with the following Julia command:

```julia
] activate .
test
```

Hope, you will see:
```
Testing Running tests...
Testing MaxPlus tests passed
```
