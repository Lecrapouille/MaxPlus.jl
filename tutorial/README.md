### Bibliography and references

- [ScicosLab](http://www.scicoslab.org/) Homepage of the Scilab still developed by
some of the researchers who originally developed Scilab at INRIA and ENPC. This

- [Jarosław Stańczyk](http://gen.up.wroc.pl/stanczyk/mpa/) gives a Matlab version (and/or GNU Octave) including a
good introduction to this algebra, modelling, analysis and control of Discrete Event Systems.
