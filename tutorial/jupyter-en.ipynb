The essential purpose of this toolkit is to facilitate matrix calculations in this algebra and takes advantage of the book [SYNCHRONIZATION AND LINEARITY: An Algebra for Discrete Event Systems](https://www.rocq.inria.fr/metalau/cohen/SED/book-online.html).\n",

This toolbox is also available directly within the Julia's packager system with the command `] add MaxPlus`. Note that initially, this toolbox was only to focus on the (max,+) algebra (since Silab only focus on max+ and this project was a pure portage) but one thing leading to another, functions for algebra (min,+) have been introduced (with version >= 0.3.0) but the name of the package `MaxPlus.jl` hasn't changed.\n",
